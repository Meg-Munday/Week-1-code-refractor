# Week-1-code-refractor: Horiseon

## Description

The original code for the Horiseon landing page used non-semantic HTML elements. Semantic HTML elements describe the purpose the element fulfils. Semantic HTML strengthens the accessibility of a webpage, providing users with a better experience of using the webpage. For example, screen readers will be better equipped to support visually impaired users to navigate the webpage. Additionally, semantic HTML supports the search engine optimization process. If this webpage used non-semantic HTML, a user with accessibility needs would find it difficult to use and interact with the webpage. 

This project reviews the original website code and replaces it using semantic HTML elements in order to increase the accessibility of the webpage. In the context of the content of this website (that is, it advertises Horiseonâ€™s services, including SEO) it illustrates the use of semantic HTML in making the webpage more visible in search engine results. The improvements to accessibility (and search engine optimization) has been achieved through the use of semantic HTML elements (e.g header, section, nav, mark, footer) and by providing alt text for images used on the webpage. 

This project was an opportunity to put into practice using HTML elements and CSS to provide structure to the layout of a webpage.
